There was a lot of work. At first, I put fruits and vegetables in one place for 2 weeks and ate juice. I was really hungry and hard day after day. At first I wanted to give up and I was not sure I could survive on a vegetarian diet. But it was a challenging experiment to try once. Although there was no way to prove how good the brain was, it was not so easy to alternate between academics and experimentation because of the continued failure to buy materials. But surely this has neatly disappeared from my headache that I have been through. In fact, it was a good thing to have done a lot of projects while doing biohackers, but even the work of documenting using feather hubs was very hard for me. Although I have not been able to be a comprehensive bio-hacker yet, I was able to think that I should continue my enthusiasm in the future with my best efforts with the attitude of starting now.

Below are my project photos.

last picture is subway meal i like this foodchain
finally i think this project 

It is a video containing scenes of vegetarianism in the meantime.
The project decided it could take a long time to get results. Daniel concluded that God gave wisdom as a person of Scripture, and judging that he had wisdom through vegetarianism could be a wrong approach.

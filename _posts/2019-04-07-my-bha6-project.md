# my final project
## why we eat vegetables?
### why genius is only vegetarian
#### so i have try to eat only vegetables for 1 month
How did I become a genius? I finally became a genius through the Bio Nuclear Academy Final Project !! In the final part of the project excuse why not.
In fact, there were many things to expect from this project. Unexpectedly, however, it has begun to drift away from university academic issues, one of the obstacles to such a project, and the delay in shipment of parts. The start was very good. I started a vegan diet, and I began to feel good feeling of body and spirit.
Actually, it was overflowing because of the energy and the desire to do anything.
I spent a month like that. My body and mind were fine, but I could not do much to check my physical condition using important brain waves and anthropometry. Also, the project of making rc cars using important brain waves was not so successful. The starter tee is clear.
The reason for this is as follows.
1. Immaturity of feather hub creation
2. The first time I visit Abu-ino Project
3. Inaccuracy of EEG sensor
4. Laziness
5. Problem of cost
6. Identification as a college student
7. Nevertheless,
I will try to show you what I have done. I will know that I am still a child.
